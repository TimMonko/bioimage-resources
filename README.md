# bioimage-resources

Resources for bioimage analysis, primarily focused around napari and neurodevelopment research.

## General Guides and Compilations

* [Bio-image Analysis Notebooks](https://haesleinhuepf.github.io/BioImageAnalysisNotebooks/intro.html): A more in depth look into image analysis using python.
* [Introduction to Bioimage analysis](https://bioimagebook.github.io/): The most general guide to biological images, describing the what, why, and how.
* [Bio-image Analysis with Python](https://github.com/BiAPoL/Bio-image_Analysis_with_Python): A course from intro to python to image processing to machine learning.

## Napari Resources

* [napari-ndev](https://github.com/timmonko/napari-ndev)
* [napari-assistant](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-assistant) and the [gpu-accelerated version](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-pyclesperanto-assistant)

## Python Image Analysis Resources

* [pyclesperanto](https://github.com/clEsperanto/pyclesperanto_prototype): accessible gpu-accelerated image analysis in python using pyopencl
* [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/): likely the most complete bio-image processing and analysis library in python
* [dask](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/) and [dask-image](https://image.dask.org/en/latest/): distributed image processing
* [simple-itk](https://simpleitk.org/): n-dimensional cross language processing
* [open-cv](https://opencv.org/): image processing mostly focus on computer vision applications and not bioimages

## Machine Learning Resources

* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): machine learning in python
