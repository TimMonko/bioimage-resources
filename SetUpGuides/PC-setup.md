# Instructions for setting up a new PC

### Windows install

For installing Windows 11, you will require internet connection. To connect to the internet at UMN, you will need to register the MAC address. To find the MAC address press `Shift + F10` to open the command prompt. Then type in `getmac` and press enter. Register this MAC address at https://wired.netaccess.umn.edu/.

### Ninite

[Ninite](https://ninite.com/) is the recommended place to download most things needed to get started. I would recommend:

- Chrome/Firefox (if you are more familiar with these browsers)
- Zoom
- Inkscape
- Notepad++
- Visual Studio Code
- SumatraPDF
- Google Drive for Desktop
- WinDirStat

### Other downloads
